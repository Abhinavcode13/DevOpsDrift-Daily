## Repository Tools
### Working with Github
- Login into your github account with your credentials
- Create Repository in Github
- Note: Repository is used to store project source code. Every project will have one repository.
- When we create a repository, unique URL is generated with Repository name.
- All the employees will connect to repository using this URL.
- We can have 2 types repository in Github
  1. Public repository
  2. Private repository
- Public repository means everybody can access but we can choose who can modify the repository.
- Private repository means we will choose who can access and who can modify the repo.
