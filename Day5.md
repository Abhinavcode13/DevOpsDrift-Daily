- When we add dependency in pom.xml maven will search for that dependency automatically in the local repository. If it is available it will add to project build path.
- If dependency not available in local repository then maven will connect to Central repository or remote repository based on our configuratiion.
- Note: By default maven will connect to central repository. If we want to use remote repository then we need to configure remote repository details.
- Every software company will maintain their own remote repository ( For example: JFrog )
